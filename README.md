This project is a visual display similar to a supermarket customer counter display.
It was developed for a food bank, so it has relevant text. (editable insource)

 The original deployment is a standard PC and a Big Screen LCD TV.
 The 'server' numbers can be controlled from any workstation with the 'client' software.
 The client is intelligent enough to find the server without configuration.
